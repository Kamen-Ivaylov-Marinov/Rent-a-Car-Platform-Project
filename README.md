# Rent-a-Car-Platform-Project
The RentACar Platform is a collaborative Python-based project where students will build a car rental management system using only functions, lists, and dictionariesâ€”no object-oriented programming or classes are required. This project simulates the process of renting, returning, and managing a fleet of cars.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:

Strengthen your understanding of Python functions, dictionaries, lists, and control flow.
Develop collaboration and project management skills.
Learn how to structure and integrate Python code for a small-scale system.
